				<aside class="post"><p>Android P has begun its developer preview, meaning that it's now available for developers, or those curious enough to check out some unfinished software. We're guessing that you fit one of those two groups, right?<br><br>Just like 2017's surprise announcement of Android Oreo, Google unveiled this year's big upgrade a few months ahead of Google IO 2018, where it will dive deep into what to expect from the final release of P – except its name. What will 'P' stand for? We have a few ideas... Based on our hands-on experience, detailed below, Android P appears to focus more on overhauling the visual design of the operating system than how it works, though leave it up to Google to still make countless changes and improvements in the coming months.Looking to download Android P for yourself? You'll need one of four phones currently supported: the Google Pixel, Google Pixel XL, Google Pixel 2 or Google Pixel 2 XL. More devices will support the software shortly after its final release, like the Google Pixel 3, but if you want beta access, going Google is the only option. </p>

				<aside class="post"><p>Launching its new flagship phone today, OnePlus joins in on the hottest trend of 2017 by nixing the display bezels, but it resists the urge to participate in another popular change by retaining its headphone jack. The new OnePlus 5T is only slightly taller than the OnePlus 5, however it fits a full 6-inch OLED display in roughly the same footprint as the earlier 5.5-inch device.<br><br> If you loved the OnePlus 5, but just wanted to see it with one of those fancy bezel-deprived displays, this new phone is the answer to your hopes.</p>

				<aside class="post"><p>Snapchat rolled out a new update last week, redesigning the entire app and, according to most people, completely ruining it.<br><br>Prior to the update, Snapchat consisted of four main pages. Your camera was in the center with your conversations on the left and your stories on the right. If you swiped an extra time to the right, you’d see a page of the sponsored stories, like Buzzfeed or Cosmopolitan, in a block formation. It was simple and easy to navigate, but the company disagreed and redesigned the app for “ease.”<br><br>Now, stories and recent conversations are forced onto the same page. When one of your friends adds something to their story, it gets boosted to the top of your recent conversation page. And when a bunch of people start posting, it pushes all the people you actually talk to to the bottom of the list, making it a challenge to find them.</p>

				<aside class="post"><p>Last year at Computex, Intel unveiled its first 10-core consumer CPU, the company's move into the world of a "megatasking." It was a pricey chip, launching at around $1,700, but it satisfied users who needed to juggle several intensive tasks at once. Now, Intel is upping the ante with a new family of processors for enthusiasts, the Core X-series and it's anchored by the company's first 18-core CPU, the i9-7980XE.<br><br>Priced at $1,999, the 7980XE is clearly not a chip you'll see in an average desktop. Instead, it's more of a statement from Intel. It beats out AMD's 16-core Threadripper CPU, which was slated to be that company's most powerful consumer processor for 2017. And it gives Intel yet another way to satisfy the demands of power-hungry users who might want to do things like play games in 4K while broadcasting them in HD over Twitch. And, as if its massive core count wasn't enough, the i9-7980XE is also the first Intel consumer chip that packs in over a teraflop's worth of computing power.</p>
